# Stencil Support

We track bugs and feature requests in this repository.

If you want to file for bug or request a feature, head over to the discussion section and create a new discusson. It will make our job easier (and faster too) to track the bug or build the feature if you can provide us with good information.

### Priority

Priority will be given on fixing bug first than adding new feature. Paying customer (regardless of tier) will be given higher priority when requesting for feature. Please also provide us with your account detail.

### I need to talk to human

All issues are handled by human but if you need to talk to the team due to other issues (i.e. payment, sensitive data, etc), please reach out to `support@usestencil.com`. 

### Guides and Documentations

They are available at https://docs.usestencil.com. If you think they are lacking and need more details, please create an issue in here. We will write a better docs üòÑ
